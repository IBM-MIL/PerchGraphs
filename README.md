A flexible graphing-driver, inspired by the [Perch app](https://vimeo.com/128847479), powered by [D3](https://github.com/mbostock/d3) and [Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular).

**PerchGraphs** handles all the parsing, translating, manipulating, interpolating, and other mathy-words-involving-[a-graph](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIlNIVXpIns) for you. You just describe how to plot your data and let **PerchGraphs** do the rest.

## Installation

1. Install [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp) with `npm install -g gulp`.
2. Get the dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Uglify and concatenate with `gulp build`.
4. Run the example with `gulp serve`.

## Overview

Include the `mil.PerchGraphs` module into your module to get all that **PerchGraphs** has to offer.

**PerchGraphs** comes with two components: the `perchGraph` directive and the `PerchGraphStrategy` interface. `perchGraph` is decorated with one attribute, `strategy`, which is an object conforming to the `PerchGraphStrategy` interface.
